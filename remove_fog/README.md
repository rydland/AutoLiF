# Remove fog in LiF
Useful during PvP, especially if you wish to scout or snipe enemies with a crossbow.
## Instructions
1. [Download AutoLiF](https://github.com/rydland/autolif/archive/master.zip) from my GitHub repository.
2. Place fogp.hlsl (master-autolif\remove_fog\fog.hlsl) in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LiF\game\eu\shaders\common\postFx
3. Click yes to replace or overwrite.
*  _Next time you launch LiF, you'll no longer have fog as weather effect._
