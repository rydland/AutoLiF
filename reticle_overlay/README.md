# Add reticles and crosshairs to LiF
Useful if you're doing PvE with a larger display resolution as the current reticle in LiF is too small to be properly seen. However, having a reticle during PvP will prove the opposite as you'll want to turn your attention to your enemy, not your reticle.
## Instructions
1. [Download AutoLiF](https://github.com/rydland/autolif/archive/master.zip) from my GitHub repository.
2. Run PlayclawInstaller.bat (autolif-master\reticle_overlay\PlayclawInstaller.bat).
3. You'll be prompted to download PlayclawInstaller.exe, click yes.
4. Run and install PlayclawInstaller.exe.
