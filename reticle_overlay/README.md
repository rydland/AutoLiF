# Add reticles and crosshairs to LiF
Useful if you're doing PvE with a larger display resolution as the current reticle in LiF is too small to be properly seen. However, having a reticle during PvP will prove the opposite as you'll want to turn your attention to your enemy, not your reticle.
## Instructions
1. [Download AutoLiF](https://github.com/rydland/autolif/archive/master.zip) from my GitHub repository.
2. Run PlayclawInstaller.bat (autolif-master\reticle_overlay\PlayclawInstaller.bat).
3. You'll be prompted to download PlayclawInstaller.exe, click yes.
4. Run and install PlayclawInstaller.exe.
5. Launch PlayClaw.
6. Click "Settings" ➜ "Software options".
7. Change "Draw grid with size" value to 1 and turn it on.
8. Close "General settings" window.
9. Click "Scene item" ➜ "Add overlay" ➜ "Image".
10. Select a preferred reticle from the "images" folder (autolif-master\reticle_overlay\images).
11. Place the overlay image/reticle in the middle of the canvas.
*  Remember to select LiF under Cature Mode in PlayClaw.
